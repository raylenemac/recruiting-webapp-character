Notes:

- I was having issues with Typescript (something to do with my dev env), so in the interest of time I removed it for now.
- I believe I've completed up to #8 in the requirements
- Some things I'd add given more time: better error handling, DRY some repeated code, improve the styling, add test cases, better managment of multiple characters, and general cleanup.
